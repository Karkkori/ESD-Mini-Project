# ESD Mini Project

## Introduction
This project integrates a Lilygo smartwatch with a Raspberry Pi to track and visualize hiking activities through a user-friendly Flask web application. By leveraging Bluetooth for data transmission, it captures real-time metrics like steps, calories burned, and distance traveled. The result is a comprehensive dashboard that offers hikers insightful visualizations of their performance, enhancing their outdoor experiences with technology. The Lilygo smartwatch software and all the included files are found inside the Watch_TTGo_fw and the Raspberry Pi software and related files can be found inside teh Rpi folder.
